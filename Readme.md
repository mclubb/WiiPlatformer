#About WiiPlatformer
This has been a learning experience in the making for a while. I have had this code base for a number of years that I would go to on and off. I am now putting it here as I am working on it again. This is also a bit of a mess as I don't really have a game design to go with. I am using this to build whatever can be fun. I have built a small game engine that really takes away the learning curve of how the wii works with devkitpro. By using Game.h/.cpp and extending it, you can get up and running in very little time. Yes, you will need to know how to use GX a little but once you figure out how to use that, then it is basic programming.
